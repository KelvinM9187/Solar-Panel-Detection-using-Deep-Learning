# Solar-Panel-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

# Project Overview
This project focuses on creating an algorithm that automatically detects solar panels from satellite or aerial images. As solar energy adoption continues to rise across the globe, especially in regions like southern Africa, the need for accurate data on solar panel installations has become critical. The project leverages computer vision techniques to identify and map solar panels, providing valuable insights for energy suppliers, urban planners, grid operators, and policy makers.

# Problem Statement
Southern African countries, including Zimbabwe, are experiencing electricity shortages, driving many households and businesses to adopt solar energy as an alternative power source. However, there is limited data on the locations and power capacities of these solar installations. Solar panel installers often keep this information private, making it difficult for energy companies and governments to assess the growth of solar energy or manage the power grid effectively.

This project aims to address this issue by developing a solar panel detection algorithm using satellite imagery. The goal is to create a comprehensive database of solar installations, which will provide critical data to improve grid management, support energy policy making, and help solar suppliers better serve the growing market.

# Project Objectives
1. Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can detect and map solar panels from satellite or aerial images.
2. Create a labeled dataset of satellite images showing solar panels.
3. Use the labeled data to train the CNN for accurate solar panel detection.
4. Evaluate the CNN's performance on unseen data and improve its accuracy.
